# Web chat
This project is a prototype showing how you can use Google's Firebase service as a database to host data for a messaging web app.
The live chat is available online (thanks to Github Pages) [here](https://oskar-codes.github.io/web-chat/).
In addition to one global chat room, you can create your own private room to which you associate a unique ID. Only the people you share that ID with will be able to access your private room.
